This is the README For asg1

I did not get everything completed because I ran out of time. My file out redirection works as does commands with arguments. My file in redirection works, but it waits for CTRL-D to close. I am hoping to finish this before it is due.
I did not get piping to work.
Lesson learned, I will start earlier.

To Run:
gmake clean
gmake
./bshell
